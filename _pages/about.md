## About Me

I am a dedicated bioinformatician passionate about exploring genetic diversity and population genomics. My current research focuses on unraveling the genetic diversity and population structure of the black soldier fly, a project that combines my love for genomics with my expertise in bioinformatics. I am deeply fascinated by the power of programming and Linux, leveraging these tools to solve complex biological questions. My work aims to contribute to our understanding of genetic variations and their implications for species adaptation and evolution.
